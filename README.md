![Krypt](https://i.ibb.co/DVF4tNW/image.png)

## Introduction
This is a code repository for a personal project working with Crypto, Web3, and blockchain technology.

## Technology used

- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) programming language to develop smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain 
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) development environment for Ethereum
- [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/) blockchain API and node service
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) JavaScript library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) CSS framework 

## How it works

Users can connect their [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) wallet to the app and send ETH to other wallets across the Ethereum network (tested on the Ropsten testnet). Users can include a message and keyword to post a gif along with their transaction. A history of the connected wallet's transactions will appear along with a personal message and gif based on the given keyword.
